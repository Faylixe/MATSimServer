## What is MATSim Server ?

**MATSim Server** is a stand alone components originally developed for
[MATSim Studio](http://matsimstudio.org) in order to delegate simulation
execution into another machine.

---

#### Distant Execution

Run simulation over a distant machine. Avoid using your personal machine resources,
and dispatch as many simulation as you want into a more powerful computing machine. It provides
features such as following.

#### RESTFull API

Upload your simulation's initial demand and run it using RESTFull API.
Data are validated, then a simulation is started. Once it is done, you
can retrieve output data using the API as well.

#### Simulation Monitoring

Track simulation progress whenever you want, including iteration number,
and simulation steps (mobsim, scoring, or replanning) as well.

## Getting started

Want to start ? Just download [MATSim Server](download.html) java binary and uploads it to your server, once it is done then run it !
